# Refraction.jl

This package provides an interface to the refractiveindex.info
database that is stored locally as JLD2 data file. This allows for:

- Computation of wavelength dependent refractive indices of the material
- Computation of wavelength dependent extinction coefficients of the material
- Computation of the transmittance of the material for a given distance
- Creation of custom materials
